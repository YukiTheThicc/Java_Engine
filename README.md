# Diamond Engine

    DEV NAME: JAVA_ENGINE

A Java game engine based on OpenGL.

This project is personal attempt to design and produce a close-to fully featured engine using Java. Its basic structure
consists on a front-end(_Sapphire_) and back-end(_Diamond_). 

## Priorities

At this moment, the priority is to develop _Sapphire_ into a state in which it has enough features to comfortably develop
the first core elements of Diamond, so they can be exposed and managed through Sapphire. This includes a file edition system, 
logging system, game viewport, customization elements and much more.

You can now edit and store files using Sapphire, aside from having key shortcuts to make your life easier

## Diamond Games

At this moment there is no game structure, as the engine and front-end are not featured enough yet to support building
a game.
